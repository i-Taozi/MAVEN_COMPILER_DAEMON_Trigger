<h3>PSSRa</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>P</b></u>igment <u><b>S</b></u>pecific <u><b>S</b></u>imple <u><b>Ra</b></u>tio (chlorophyll index)
    algorithm was developed by Blackburn (1998). It investigates the potential of a range of spectral approaches for quantifying  pigments  at  the  scale  of  the  whole  plant  canopy <br><br>

    When  applying  existing  narrow-band  pigment  indices, the  PSSR  algorithms  have  the  strongest  and  most  linear relationships  with  canopy  concentration<br>
    per  unit  area  of Chl a (Chlorophyll a), Chl b (Chlorophyll b) and Cars (carotenoids).<br><br>
</p>



<p>
    The PSSRa results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>PSSRa = (IR_factor * near_IR) / (red_factor * red)</b> <br><br>
</p>


<p>
    For <b>Sentinel-2</b> the formula is: <br><br>
    <b>B7 / B4</b>, where (Central wavelength/Bandwidth): B7 =  783 nm (15 nm) and B4 = 665 nm (30 nm)
</p>

<h3>PSSRa-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'pssra_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for PSSRa is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for PSSRa is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for PSSRa is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
