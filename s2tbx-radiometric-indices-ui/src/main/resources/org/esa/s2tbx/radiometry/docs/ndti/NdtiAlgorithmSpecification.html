<h3>NDTI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>N</b></u>ormalized <u><b>D</b></u>ifference <u><b>T</b></u>urbidity <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was developed by J.P Lacaux & al. (2006), allowing for the measurement of water turbidity. <br><br>


    Wetlands are one of our most important yet endangered and underevalued environments. <br>
    Sustainable management of wetland ecosystem is necessary as it serves the important functions such
    as food storage, water quality maintenance and providing habitat for different species of wildlife. <br>
    More than 75% of commercial fish species require wetlands to complete part of their life cycle. <br>
    Many local and migratory birds also utilize coastal wetlands as breeding and roosting sites as well
    as providing food and habitat for many animal and plant species. <br>
    Wetlands are also a valuable buffer against coastal erosion, storm surges and flooding.  <br><br>
</p>



<p>
    The NDTI results from the following equation: <br>
</p>

<p>
    <b>NDTI = (red_factor * red - green_factor * green) / (red_factor * red + green_factor * green)</b> <br><br>

</p>


<h3>NDTI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'ndti_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for NDTI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for NDTI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for NDTI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
