<h3>CI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>C</b></u>olour <u><b>I</b></u>ndex algorithm was developed to differentiate soils in the field - Pouget et al.(1990). <br><br>

    Low valued CIs have been shown to be correlated with the presence of a high concentration of carbonates or sulfates and higher values to be correlated with crusted soils and sands in arid regions (Escadfal, 1989). <br>
    In most cases the CI gives complementary information with the BI and the NDVI. Used for diachronic analyses, they help for a better understanding of the evolution of soil surfaces <br><br>

</p>


<p>
    The CI results from the following equation: <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    <b>CI = (red_factor * red - green_factor * green) / (red_factor * red + green_factor * green)</b><br><br>
</p>


<h3>CI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'ci_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for CI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for CI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for CI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
