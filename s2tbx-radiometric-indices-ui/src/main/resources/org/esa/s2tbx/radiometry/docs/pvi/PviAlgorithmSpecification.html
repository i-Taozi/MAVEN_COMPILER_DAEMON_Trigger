<h3>PVI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>P</b></u>erpendicular <u><b>V</b></u>egetation <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was first described by Richardson and Wiegand (1977). <br><br>

    This could be considered a generalization of the DVI which allows for soil lines of different slopes. <br>
    PVI is quite sensitive to atmospheric variations, (Qi et al., 1994). <br>
    Consequently, comparing PVI values for data taken at different dates is hazardous unless an atmospheric correction is performed on the data.<br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The PVI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <br><b>PVI = sin(a) * IR_factor * near_IR - cos(a) * red_factor * red</b><br>
</p>

<p>
    where: <b>a</b> is the angle between the soil line and the NIR axis, in degrees. <br>
</p>


<h3>PVI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'pvi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for PVI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for PVI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for PVI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
