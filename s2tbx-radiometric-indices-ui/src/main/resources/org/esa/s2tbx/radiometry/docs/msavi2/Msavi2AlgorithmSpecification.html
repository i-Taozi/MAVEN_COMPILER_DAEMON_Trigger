<h3>MSAVI2</h3>

<p>
    The <b>second</b> <u><b>M</b></u>odified <u><b>S</b></u>oil <u><b>A</b></u>djusted <u><b>V</b></u>egetation <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was was developed by Qi et al. (1994) as a recursion of <a href="../msavi/MsaviAlgorithmSpecification.html"><b>MSAVI</b></a> <br><br>

    Basically, they use an iterative process and substitute 1 - MSAVI(n-1) as the <b>L</b> factor in MSAVI(n). <br>
    They then inductively solve the iteration where MSAVI(n) = MSAVI(n-1)<br>
    In the process, the need to precalculate <a href="../wdvi/WdviAlgorithmSpecification.html"><b>WDVI</b></a> and <b>NDVI</b> and the need to find the soil line are eliminated.<br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The MSAVI2 results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>MSAVI2 = (1/2) * ( 2 * IR_factor * near_IR + 1 - sqrt( ( 2 * IR_factor * near_IR + 1) * ( 2 * IR_factor * near_IR + 1) - 8 * (IR_factor * near_IR - red_factor * red) ) )</b><br><br>


</p>


<p>
    Not all soils are alike. Different soils have different reflectance spectra.<br>
    All of the vegetation indices assume that there is a soil line, where there is a single slope in RED-NIR space.<br>
    However, it is often the case that there are soils with different RED-NIR slopes in a single image.<br>
    Also, if the assumption about the isovegetation lines (parallel or intercepting at the origin) is not exactly right,<br>
    changes in soil moisture (which move along isovegetation lines) will give incorrect answers for the vegetation index.<br>
    The problem of soil noise is most acute when vegetation cover is low.<br>
    The following group of indices attempt to reduce soil noise by altering the behavior of the isovegetation lines.<br>
    All of them are ratio-based, and the way that they attempt to reduce soil noise is by shifting the place where the isovegetation lines meet.<br>
    <b>WARNING</b>: These indices reduce soil noise at the cost of decreasing the dynamic range of the index.<br>
    These indices are slightly less sensitive to changes in vegetation cover than NDVI (but more sensitive than PVI) at low levels of vegetation cover.<br>
    These indices are also more sensitive to atmospheric variations than NDVI (but less so than PVI). (See Qi et al. (1994) for comparisons.) <br><br>

<h3>MSAVI2-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'msavi2_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for MSAVI2 is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for MSAVI2 is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for MSAVI2 is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
