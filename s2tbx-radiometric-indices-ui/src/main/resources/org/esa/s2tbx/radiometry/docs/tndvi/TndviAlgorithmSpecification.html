<h3>TNDVI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>T</b></u>ransformed <u><b>N</b></u>ormalized <u><b>D</b></u>ifference <u><b>V</b></u>egetation <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm indicates a relation between the amount of green biomass that is found in a pixel. (Senseman et.al. 1996) <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Transformed Normalised Difference Vegetation index (TNDVI) is the square root of the NDVI.<br>
    It has higher coefficient of determination for the same variable and this is the difference between TNDVI and NDVI.<br>
    The formula of TNDVI has always positive values and the variances of the ratio are proportional to mean values.<br><br>

</p>

<p>
    The TNDVI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <br>
    <b>TNDVI = sqrt( (IR_factor * near_IR - red_factor * red) / (IR_factor * near_IR + red_factor * red) + 0.5)</b><br><br>
</p>


<h3>TNDVI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'tndvi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for TNDVI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for TNDVI is less than 0 (zero)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for TNDVI is greater than 1.23 (one point two three)</td></tr>
