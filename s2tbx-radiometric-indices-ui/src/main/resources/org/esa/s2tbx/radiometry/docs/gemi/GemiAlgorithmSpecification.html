<h3>GEMI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>G</b></u>lobal <u><b>E</b></u>nvironmental <u><b>M</b></u>onitoring <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was developed by Pinty and Verstraete (1991). <br><br>

    They attempt to eliminate the need for a detailed atmospheric correction by constructing a <b>stock</b> atmospheric correction for the vegetation index.<br>
    Pinty and Verstraete (1991) provide no detailed reasoning for this index, other than that it meets their requirements of insensitivity to the atmosphere empirically.<br>
    A paper by Leprieur et al. (1994) claims to find that GEMI is superior to other indices for satellite measurements.<br>
    Qi et al. (1994) shows a violent breakdown of GEMI with respect to soil noise at low vegetation covers. <br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The GEMI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>GEMI = eta * (1 - 0.25 * eta) - (red_factor * red - 0.125) / (1 - red_factor * red)</b> <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    , where: <br><br>
    <b>eta = (2 * (IR_factor * near_IR * IR_factor * near_IR - red_factor * red * red_factor * red) + 1.5 * IR_factor * near_IR + 0.5 * red_factor * red) / (IR_factor * near_IR + red_factor * red + 0.5)</b><br><br>

</p>

<p>
    The atmosphere is changing all of the time and all remote sensing instruments have to look through it.<br>
    The atmosphere both attenuates light passing through it and scatters light from suspended aerosols.<br>
    Also, the atmosphere can vary strongly across a single scene, especially in areas with high relief.<br>
    This alters the light seen by the instrument and can cause variations in the calculated values of vegetation indices.<br>
    This is particularly a problem for comparing vegetation index values for different dates.<br>
    The GEMI index is trying to remedy this problem without the requirement of atmospherically corrected data. <br>
    <b>WARNING</b>: These indices achieve their reduced sensitivity to the atmosphere by decreasing the dynamic range.<br>
    They are generally slightly less sensitive to changes in vegetation cover than NDVI.<br>
    At low levels they are very sensitive to the soil background. (See Qi et al. (1994) for comparisons.) <br><br>

<h3>GEMI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'gemi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for GEMI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for GEMI is less than 0 (zero)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for GEMI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
