<h3>IPVI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>I</b></u>nfrared <u><b>P</b></u>ercentage <u><b>V</b></u>egetation <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was first described by Crippen (1990). <br><br>

    Crippen found that the subtraction of the red in the numerator was irrelevant, and proposed this index as a way of improving calculation speed.<br>
    It is restricted to values between 0 and 1, which eliminates the need for storing a sign for the vegetation index values.<br>
    It also eliminates the conceptual strangeness of negative values for vegetation indices. <br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The IPVI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <br><b>IPVI = (IR_factor * near_IR) / (IR_factor * near_IR + red_factor * red)</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    or:<br><br>
    <b>IPVI = 1/2 * (NDVI + 1)</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
   where: <b>NDVI = (IR_factor * near_IR - red_factor * red) / (IR_factor * near_IR + red_factor * red)</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Conclussions: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- IPVI is functionally equivalent to NDVI and RVI, but it only ranges in value from 0.0 - 1.0 <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- IPVI eliminates one mathematical operation per image pixel which is important for the rapid processing of large amounts of data. <br><br>
</p>

<h3>IPVI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'ipvi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for IPVI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for IPVI is less than 0 (zero)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for IPVI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
