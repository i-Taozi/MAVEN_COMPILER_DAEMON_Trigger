<h3>MNDWI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>M</b></u>odified <u><b>N</b></u>ormalized <u><b>D</b></u>ifference <u><b>W</b></u>ater <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was developed by Xu, 2006 and can enhance open water features while efficiently suppressing and even removing built-up  land  noise  as  well  as  vegetation  and  soil  noise. <br><br>

    The  greater  enhancement  of  water  in  the  MNDWI-image  will  result  in  more accurate extraction of open water features <br>
    as the built-up land, soil and vegetation all negative values and thus are notably suppressed and even removed. <br><br>
</p>



<p>
    The MNDWI results from the following equation: <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    <b>MNDWI = (green_factor * green - mir_factor * middle_IR) / (green_factor * green + mir_factor * middle_IR)</b> <br><br>
</p>


<h3>MNDWI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'mndwi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for MNDWI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for MNDWI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for MNDWI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
