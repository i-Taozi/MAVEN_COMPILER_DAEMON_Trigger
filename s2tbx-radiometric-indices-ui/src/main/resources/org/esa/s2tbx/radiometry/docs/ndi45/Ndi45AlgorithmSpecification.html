<h3>NDI45</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>N</b></u>ormalized <u><b>D</b></u>ifference <u><b>I</b></u>ndex algorithm is more linear, with less saturation at higher values than the NDVI. <br><br>

    Some algorithms have already been presented in work by Delegido et al. (2011b) which specifically investigated the optimal bands to use in the NDVI formula with synthesised Sentinel-2 data. <br>
    Research found that bands 4 and 5 were the optimal combination.<br><br>

</p>


<p>
    The NDI45 results from the following (Sensor-dependent) equation: <br><br>
</p>

<p>

    <b>NDI45 = (IR_factor * near_IR - red_factor * red) / (IR_factor * near_IR + red_factor * red)</b><br><br>

</p>

<p>
    For <b>Sentinel-2</b> the formula is: <br><br>
    <b>(B5 - B4) / (B5 + B4)</b>, where (Central wavelength/Bandwidth): B5 = 705 nm (15 nm), B4 = 665 nm (30 nm) <br><br>

</p>


<h3>NDI45-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'ndi45_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for NDI45 is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for NDI45 is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for NDI45 is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
</table>
