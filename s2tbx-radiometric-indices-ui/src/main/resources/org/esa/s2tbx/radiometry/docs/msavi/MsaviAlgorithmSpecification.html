<h3>MSAVI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>M</b></u>odified <u><b>S</b></u>oil <u><b>A</b></u>djusted <u><b>V</b></u>egetation <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was was developed by Qi et al. (1994) <br><br>

    The adjustment factor <b>L</b> for SAVI depends on the level of vegetation cover being observed.<br>
    This leads to the circular problem of needing to know the vegetation cover before calculating the vegetation index, which is what gives you the vegetation cover.<br>
    The basic idea of <b>MSAVI</b> was to provide a variable correction factor <b>L</b>. <br>
    The correction factor used is based on the product of <b>NDVI</b> and <b>WDVI</b>. This means that the isovegetation lines do not converge to a single point. <br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The MSAVI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>MSAVI = (1 + L) * (IR_factor * near_IR - red_factor * red) / (IR_factor * near_IR + red_factor * red + L)</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    where: <b>L = 1 - 2 * s * NDVI * <a href="../wdvi/WdviAlgorithmSpecification.html"><b>WDVI</b></a></b> and <b>s</b> is the soil line slope <br>
</p>

<p>
    Not all soils are alike. Different soils have different reflectance spectra.<br>
    All of the vegetation indices assume that there is a soil line, where there is a single slope in RED-NIR space.<br>
    However, it is often the case that there are soils with different RED-NIR slopes in a single image.<br>
    Also, if the assumption about the isovegetation lines (parallel or intercepting at the origin) is not exactly right,<br>
    changes in soil moisture (which move along isovegetation lines) will give incorrect answers for the vegetation index.<br>
    The problem of soil noise is most acute when vegetation cover is low.<br>
    The following group of indices attempt to reduce soil noise by altering the behavior of the isovegetation lines.<br>
    All of them are ratio-based, and the way that they attempt to reduce soil noise is by shifting the place where the isovegetation lines meet.<br>
    <b>WARNING</b>: These indices reduce soil noise at the cost of decreasing the dynamic range of the index.<br>
    These indices are slightly less sensitive to changes in vegetation cover than NDVI (but more sensitive than PVI) at low levels of vegetation cover.<br>
    These indices are also more sensitive to atmospheric variations than NDVI (but less so than PVI). (See Qi et al. (1994) for comparisons.) <br><br>

<h3>MSAVI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'msavi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for MSAVI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for MSAVI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for MSAVI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
