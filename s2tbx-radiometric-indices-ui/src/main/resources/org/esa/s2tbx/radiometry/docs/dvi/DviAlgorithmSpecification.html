<h3>DVI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>D</b></u>ifference <u><b>V</b></u>egetation <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm is sensitive to the amount of vegetation.
</p>

<p>
    This is the simplest vegetation index:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Sensitive to the amount of vegetation<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Distinguishes between soil and vegetation<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Does NOT deal with the difference between reflectance and radiance caused by the atmosphere or shadows<br><br>

</p>

<p>
    The DVI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>DVI = (IR_factor * near_IR - red_factor * red)</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    In the area of red the incoming solar radiation won´t be extensively absorbed by the pigments
    of the mesophyll inside the folios, primarily by the chlorophyll.<br>
    In the area of the near infrared in contrast the bigger part of the incoming radiation was reflected.
</p>

<h3>DVI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'dvi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for DVI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for DVI is less than -Infinity </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for DVI is greater than Infinity</td></tr>
