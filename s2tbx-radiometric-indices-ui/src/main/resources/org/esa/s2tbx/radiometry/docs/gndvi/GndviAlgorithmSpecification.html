<h3>GNDVI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>G</b></u>reen <u><b>N</b></u>ormalized <u><b>D</b></u>ifference <u><b>V</b></u>egetation <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was developed by Gitelson et al. (1996).<br><br>

    The authors verified that GNDVI was more sensible than NDVI to identify different concentration rates of chlorophyll, which is highly correlated at nitrogen. <br>
    The use of green spectral band was more efficient than the red spectral band to discriminate nitrogen.<br><br>
</p>



<p>
    The GNDVI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    GNDVI = (IR_factor * near_IR - green_factor * green) / (IR_factor * near_IR + green_factor * green)
</p>


<h3>GNDVI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'gndvi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for GNDVI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for GNDVI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for GNDVI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
