<h3>MTCI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>M</b></u>eris <u><b>T</b></u>errestrial <u><b>C</b></u>hlorophyll <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was developed by Dash and Curran (2004) for estimating chlorophyll content from MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) data.<br><br>

    The MTCI aims at estimating the Red Edge Position (REP). This is the maximum slant point in the red and near-infrared region of the vegetal spectral reflectance. <br>
    It is useful for observing the chlorophyll contents, vegetation senescence, and stress for water and nutritional deficiencies, but it is less suitable for land classification. <br><br>
</p>



<p>
    The MTCI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>MTCI = (IR_factor * near_IR - red_factor2 * red2) / (red_factor2 * red2 - red_factor1 * red1)</b> <br><br>
</p>


<p>
    For Sentinel-2 the formula is: <br><br>
     <b>(B6 - B5)/(B5 - B4)</b>, where (Central wavelength/Bandwidth): B6 = 740 nm (15 nm), B5 = 705 nm (15 nm), B4 = 665 nm (30 nm)
</p>

<h3>MTCI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'mtci_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for MTCI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for MTCI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for MTCI is greater than Floating Point Maximum Value</td></tr>
</table>
