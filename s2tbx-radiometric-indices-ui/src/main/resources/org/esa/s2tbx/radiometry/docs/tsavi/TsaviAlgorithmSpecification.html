<h3>TSAVI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>T</b></u>ransformed <u><b>S</b></u>oil <u><b>A</b></u>djusted <u><b>V</b></u>egetation <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was developed by Baret et al. (1989) and Baret and Guyot (1991) <br><br>

    This index assumes that the soil line has arbitrary slope and intercept, and it makes use of these values to adjust the vegetation index.<br>
    This would be a nice way of escaping the arbitrariness of the L in SAVI, if an additional adjustment parameter had not been included in the index.<br>
    The parameter <b>X</b> was adjusted so as to minimize the soil background effect. The value reported in the papers is <b>0.08</b>. <br>
    The convergence point of the isovegetation lines lies between the origin and the usually-used SAVI convergence point (for L = 0.5).<br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The TSAVI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>TSAVI = s * (IR_factor * near_IR - s * red_factor * red - a) / (s * IR_factor * near_IR + red_factor * red - a * s + X * ( 1 + s * s ))</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    where:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <b>a</b> is the soil line intercept <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <b>s</b> is the soil line slope <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <b>X</b> is the adjustment factor to minimize soil noise. <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Not all soils are alike. Different soils have different reflectance spectra.<br>
    All of the vegetation indices assume that there is a soil line, where there is a single slope in RED-NIR space.<br>
    However, it is often the case that there are soils with different RED-NIR slopes in a single image.<br>
    Also, if the assumption about the isovegetation lines (parallel or intercepting at the origin) is not exactly right,<br>
    changes in soil moisture (which move along isovegetation lines) will give incorrect answers for the vegetation index.<br>
    The problem of soil noise is most acute when vegetation cover is low.<br>
    The following group of indices attempt to reduce soil noise by altering the behavior of the isovegetation lines.<br>
    All of them are ratio-based, and the way that they attempt to reduce soil noise is by shifting the place where the isovegetation lines meet.<br>
    <b>WARNING</b>: These indices reduce soil noise at the cost of decreasing the dynamic range of the index.<br>
    These indices are slightly less sensitive to changes in vegetation cover than NDVI (but more sensitive than PVI) at low levels of vegetation cover.<br>
    These indices are also more sensitive to atmospheric variations than NDVI (but less so than PVI). (See Qi et al. (1994) for comparisons.) <br><br>

<h3>TSAVI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'tsavi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for TSAVI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for TSAVI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for TSAVI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
