<h3>NDWI2</h3>

<p>
    The <b>second</b> <u><b>N</b></u>ormalized <u><b>D</b></u>ifference <u><b>W</b></u>ater <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was developed by McFeeters (1996) to detect surface waters in wetland environments and to allow for the measurement of surface water extent .<br><br>

</p>



<p>
    The NDWI2 results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>NDWI2 = (green_factor * green - IR_factor * near_IR) / (green_factor * green + IR_factor * near_IR)</b> <br><br>
</p>


<h3>NDWI2-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'ndwi2_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for NDWI2 is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for NDWI2 is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for NDWI2 is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
