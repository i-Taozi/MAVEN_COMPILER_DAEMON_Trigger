<h3>WDVI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>W</b></u>eighted <u><b>D</b></u>ifference <u><b>V</b></u>egetation <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was introduced by Clevers (1988).<br><br>

    This has a relationship to PVI similar to the relationship IPVI has to NDVI.<br>
    WDVI is a mathematically simpler version of PVI, but it has an unrestricted range.<br>
    Like PVI, WDVI is very sensitive to atmospheric variations (Qi et al., 1994).<br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The WDVI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>WDVI = (IR_factor * near_IR - g * red_factor * red)</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    where: <b>g</b> is the slope of the soil line. <br>
</p>


<h3>WDVI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'wdvi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for WDVI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for WDVI is less than -Infinity</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for WDVI is greater than Infinity</td></tr>
