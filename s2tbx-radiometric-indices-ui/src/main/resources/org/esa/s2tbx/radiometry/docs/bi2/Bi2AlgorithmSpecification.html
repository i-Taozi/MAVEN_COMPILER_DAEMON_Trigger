<h3>BI2</h3>

<p>
    The <b>second</b> <u><b>B</b></u>rightness <u><b>I</b></u>ndex algorithm is representing the average of the brightness of a satellite image. <br><br>

    The result looks like a panchromatic image with the same resolution of the original image. <br>
    This index is therefore sensitive to the brightness of soils which is highly correlated with the humidity and the presence of salts in surface (Escadafal, 1989). <br><br>

</p>


<p>
    The BI2 results from the following equation: <br>
</p>

<p>
    <b>BI2 = sqrt( ( (red_factor * red * red_factor * red) + (green_factor * green * green_factor * green) + (IR_factor * near_IR * IR_factor * near_IR) ) / 3 )</b><br><br>
    
</p>


<h3>BI2-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'bi2_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for BI2 is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for BI2 is less than 0 (zero)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for BI2 is greater than Floating Point Maximum Value</td></tr>
