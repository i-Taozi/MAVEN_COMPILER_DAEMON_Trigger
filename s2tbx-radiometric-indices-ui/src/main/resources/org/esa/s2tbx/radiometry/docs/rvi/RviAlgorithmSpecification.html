<h3>RVI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>R</b></u>atio <u><b>V</b></u>egetation <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm is the simplest ratio-based one.
</p>

<p>
    The simplest ratio-based index is also called the Simple Ratio (SR):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- High for vegetation<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Low for soil, ice, water, etc.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Indicates amount of vegetation<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reduces the effects of atmosphere and topography<br><br>

</p>

<p>
    The RVI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>RVI = (IR_factor * near_IR) / (red_factor * red)</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    This is the most widely calculated vegetation index, although you rarely hear of it as a vegetation index.<br>
    A common practice in remote sensing is the use of band ratios (e.g. the ratio of NIR to RED) to eliminate various effects such as:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- irradiance (topography)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- transmittance (atmospheric effects)<br><br>

</p>

<h3>RVI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'rvi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for RVI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for RVI is less than 0 (zero)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for RVI is greater than Infinity</td></tr>
