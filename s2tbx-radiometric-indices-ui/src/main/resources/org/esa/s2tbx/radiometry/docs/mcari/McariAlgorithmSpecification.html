<h3>MCARI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>M</b></u>odified <u><b>C</b></u>hlorophyll <u><b>A</b></u>bsorption <u><b>R</b></u>atio <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was developed by Daughtry et al. (2000) to be responsive to chlorophyll variation.<br><br>

    This algorithm is responsive to both leaf chlorophyll concentrations and ground reflectance. <br><br>
</p>



<p>
    The MCARI results from the following equation:<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    <b>MCARI = ((red_factor2 * red2 - red_factor1 * red1) - 0.2 * (red_factor2 * red2 - green_factor * green)) * (red_factor2 * red2 / red_factor1 * red1)</b> <br><br>

</p>


<p>
    For <b>Sentinel-2</b> the formula is: <br><br>
    <b>[(B5 - B4) - 0.2 * (B5 - B3)] * (B5 / B4)</b>, where (Central wavelength/Bandwidth): B5 = 705 nm (15 nm), B4 = 665 nm (30 nm), B3 = 560 nm (35 nm)
</p>

<h3>MCARI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'mcari_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for MCARI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for MCARI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for MCARI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
</table>
