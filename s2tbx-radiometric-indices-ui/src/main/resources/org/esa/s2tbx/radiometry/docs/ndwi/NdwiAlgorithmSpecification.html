<h3>NDWI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>N</b></u>ormalized <u><b>D</b></u>ifference <u><b>W</b></u>ater <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was developed by Gao (19964), being a measure of liquid water molecules in vegetation canopies that interacted with the incoming solar radiation.<br><br>

    NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. It is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. <br>
    NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, therefore it should be considered as an independent vegetation index. <br>
    It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. <br><br>
</p>



<p>
    The NDWI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>NDWI = (IR_factor * near_IR - mir_factor * middle_IR) / (IR_factor * near_IR + mir_factor * middle_IR)</b> <br><br>
</p>


<h3>NDWI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'ndwi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for NDWI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for NDWI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for NDWI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
