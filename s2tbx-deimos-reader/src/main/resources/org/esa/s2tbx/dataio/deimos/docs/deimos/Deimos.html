    <h3>Import Deimos Products</h3>

    <p>This command allows to import the data of Deimos 1 products in DIMAP format.
        The payload is a three-band multispectral imager system with 22m Ground Sample Distance (GSD) at
        nominal altitude (663 km) with 625 km swath, 8 or 10 bits radiometric depth available. Imager delivers data
        in three spectral bands, very close to the Near-Infrared (NIR), Red (R) and Green (G) bands in the Landsat
        series of US satellites. The satellite payload is a dual bank linear CCD push broom imager, so that banks are
        mounted at an angle to provide a wide imaging swath, one of the most characteristics DEIMOS-1 features.
    </p>
    <p>For more details please see: <a href="https://apollomapping.com/wp-content/user_uploads/2012/10/DEIMOS-1_Product_Guide.pdf">DEIMOS-1 Product Guide</a></p>
    <p>The spectral bandwidth and profiles of DEIMOS-1 imager, equivalent to those of Landsat ETM+ instrument,
        are outlined in the next table.</p>

    <h4>DMI DIMAP</h4>
    <p>
    The metadata for image products are contained within the DIMAP (.dim) files. DMI DIMAP is based upon the
    DIMAP generic profile version 1.1 developed by SpotImage and CNES, and is implemented through the use
    of XML. A detail description is provided in
    <a href="https://apollomapping.com/wp-content/user_uploads/2012/10/DEIMOS-1_Product_Guide.pdf">DEIMOS-1 Product Guide</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some elements of the DIMAP are not clearly defined and open for data providers to define their own
    parameters. For such elements used in the DMC DIMAP, a description of these elements and examples will
    be given in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
    Documentation on DIMAP version 1.1 and the DIMAP XML implementation can be found at the following
    URL: <a href="http://www.spotimage.fr/dimap/spec/documentation/refdoc.htm">
        http://www.spotimage.fr/dimap/spec/documentation/refdoc.htm</a>. The DIMAP elements and their
    implementation are described in documents RD#02 and RD#03, which can be found at the following
    URL: <a href="http://www.spotimage.fr/dimap/spec/dictionary/dictionary.htm">

    <h4>File Naming Convention</h4>
    <p>
    Image files are provided with a standard file naming convention explained below by means of an example.
    </p>
    <p>Example:
    <b>DE01_SL6_22P_1T_20110616T092316_20110616T092427_DMI_0_2e9d</b>
    </p>
    <p>Convention meaning:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>DE01: Mission</li>
        <li>SL6: Instrument</li>
        <li>22: resolution</li>
        <li>P: imager bank. Can take the following values: P (bank p), S (bank s) or T (two banks merged
            together)</li>
        <li>1T: processing level</li>
        <li>20110616T092316: date and hour of the beginning of the image capture</li>
        <li>20110616T092427: date and hour of the end of the image capture</li>
        <li>DMI: Company</li>
        <li>0: internal code</li>
        <li>2e9d: Image Identification Code</li>
    </ul>
