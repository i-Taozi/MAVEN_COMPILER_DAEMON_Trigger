    <h3>Import RapidEye Products</h3>

    <p>This command allows to import the data of RapidEye products in GeoTIFF format.
        RapidEye Satellite Imagery Products are offered at three different processing types to support the varied needs
        of the customer:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>RapidEye Basic (Level 1B) products are sensor level products with a minimal amount of processing
            (geometrically uncorrected) for customers who prefer to geo-correct the images themselves;</li>
        <li>RapidEye Ortho (Level 3A) are orthorectified tile products with radiometric, geometric and terrain
            corrections in a map projection;</li>
        <li>RapidEye Ortho Take (Level 3B) are orthorectified, bundle adjusted image takes that are larger than the
            Level 3A products.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>For more details please see: <a href="http://www.blackbridge.com/rapideye/upload/RE_Product_Specifications_ENG.pdf">

    <h4>RAPIDEYE BASIC – LEVEL 1B PRODUCT SPECIFICATION</h4>
    <p>
        The RapidEye Basic product is the least processed of the available RapidEye image products. This product is
        designed for customers with advanced image processing capabilities and a desire to geometrically correct the
        product themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        The RapidEye Basic product is radiometric and sensor corrected, providing imagery as seen from the spacecraft
        without correction for any geometric distortions inherent in the imaging process, and is not mapped to a
        cartographic projection. The imagery data is accompanied by all spacecraft telemetry necessary for the
        processing of the data into a geo-corrected form, or when matched with a stereo pair, for the generation of
        digital elevation data. Resolution of the images is 6.5 meters GSD at nadir. The images are resampled to a
        coordinate system defined by an ideal basic camera model for band alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        RapidEye Basic image product consists of the following file components:
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Image File – Image product delivered as a group of single-band NITF 2.0 or GeoTIFF files with associated
            RPC values. Bands are co-registered.
        </li>
        <li>Metadata File – XML format metadata file. Metadata file contains additional information related to spacecraft
            attitude, spacecraft ephemeris, spacecraft temperature measurements, line imaging times, camera geometry,
            and radiometric calibration data.
        </li>
        <li>Browse Image File – GeoTIFF format
        </li>
        <li>Unusable Data Mask (UDM) file – GeoTIFF format
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>RAPIDEYE ORTHO – LEVEL 3A PRODUCT SPECIFICATION</h4>
    <p>
        The RapidEye Ortho product offers RapidEye Satellite imagery orthorectified as individual 25 by 25 kilometer
        tiles. This product was designed for a wide variety of applications that require imagery with an accurate
        geolocation and cartographic projection. It has been processed to remove distortions caused by terrain and can
        be used for many cartographic purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The RapidEye Ortho product is radiometric, sensor and geometrically corrected and aligned to a cartographic
        map projection. The geometric correction uses fine DEMs with a post spacing of between 30 and 90 meters. Ground
        Control Points (GCPs) are used in the creation of every image and the accuracy of the product will vary from
        region to region based on available GCPs. RapidEye Ortho image products are output as 25 by 25 kilometer tiles
        referenced to a fixed, standard RapidEye image tile grid system (see Appendix B). All Ortho image products
        (Level 3A) are black-filled 1000 meters (200 pixels) beyond the order polygon used to place the product order,
        except for when the order is tile-based. The Browse Image and Unusable Data Mask (UDM) files of an Ortho product
        show the full extent of valid imagery available for the given image tile regardless of the black-fill applied
        to an order.
    </p>
    <p>RapidEye Ortho image product consists of the following file components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Image File – GeoTIFF file that contains image data and geolocation information</li>
        <li>Metadata File – XML format metadata file</li>
        <li>Browse Image File – GeoTIFF format</li>
        <li>Unusable Data Mask (UDM) file – GeoTIFF format</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>RAPIDEYE ORTHO TAKE– LEVEL 3B PRODUCT SPECIFICATION</h4>
    <p>
        The RapidEye Ortho Take product extends the usability of orthorectified RapidEye products by leveraging full
        image takes and adjusts multiple images together to cover larger areas with fewer files. These products are
        radiometric, sensor and geometrically corrected and aligned to a cartographic map projection. The geometric
        correction uses fine DEMs with a post spacing of between 30 and 90 meters. Ground Control Points (GCPs) and
        DEM are used in the creation of every image.
    </p>
    <p>
        Multiple images may be used to cover the desired order polygon and those images will be bundle adjusted together
        before orthorectification, but each image will be produced and delivered as a separate standalone file with
        no mosaicking or color balancing being performed.
    </p>
    <p>RapidEye Ortho Take image product consists of the following file components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Image File – GeoTIFF file that contains image data and geolocation information</li>
        <li>Metadata File – XML format metadata file.</li>
        <li>Browse Image File – GeoTIFF format</li>
        <li>Unusable Data Mask (UDM) file – GeoTIFF format</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>PRODUCT NAMING</h3>
    <p>
        The naming of RapidEye Satellite Imagery Products provides important information related to the image.
        The naming of the product depends on the product type and is different between the product levels.
